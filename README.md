# TUM Player
## Wat?
If you study Computer Science at TUM - like I do - at some point you decide not to go to a lecture, but instead to watch its recording.    
As Prof. Bungartz tends to be a teeny bit boring I like to do other stuff while listenning to the highly interesting things he might have to say.   
This app will give you the option to view the recordings in picture-in-picture mode on an iPad.

## How?
1. Get a [Mac](http://www.apple.com/de/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro?product=MLH42D/)
2. Download [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
3. Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/finngaida/tumplayer.git`)
4. Open the `.xcoderoj`
5. Connect your device and click the play button

Alternatively just hit me up in Garching and I might just install it for you.
